I am a research scientist at Stanford University in the W. W. Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory, where I study the Sun and space weather as a member of the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory science team. I previously worked at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, where I studied solar flares as a member of two NASA Heliophysics missions called TRACE and <i> Hinode</i>.</br>
</br>
My research focuses on analyzing large data sets, on the scale of terabytes to petabytes, that describe the Sun and space weather, and I authored a book on the subject titled <i> Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining for Heliophysics</i>. I also serve as Vice Chair of the Advisory Board for the SunPy Project, which develops a Python-based ecosystem of open source scientific software for data analysis in solar physics, and the heliophysics Topic Editor for the <i> Journal of Open Source Software</i> (JOSS). I am also a Contributing Editor at <i> Sky & Telescope</i> magazine, covering topics related to the Sun and Sun-like stars.</br>
