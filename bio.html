For the last 11 years, until July 2021, I was a research scientist at Stanford University in the W. W. Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory, where I studied the Sun and space weather as a member of the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory science team. My research focused on analyzing large data sets, on the scale of terabytes to petabytes, that describe the Sun and space weather, and I authored a book on the subject titled <i> Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Mining for Heliophysics</i>. I previously worked at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, where I studied solar flares as a member of two NASA Heliophysics missions called TRACE and <i> Hinode</i>.</br>

I continue to serve as Vice Chair of the Advisory Board for the SunPy Project, which develops a Python-based ecosystem of open source scientific software for data analysis in solar physics, the heliophysics Topic Editor for the <i> Journal of Open Source Software</i> (JOSS), and Contributing Editor at <i> Sky & Telescope</i> magazine, where I cover topics related to the Sun and Sun-like stars.</br>
